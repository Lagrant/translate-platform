# translation-platform

This is a for multi-translators collaboration platform. A project manager can upload a pdf book to this platform, 
it will convert pdf file to docx and replace key terms in the book automatically. Then it will be translated to target language
by machine. After that, project manager can split the book to several parts can distrubte to different translators.
Translators can edit docx files on line, and they can check each other's progress real-time. After all translators done, those docx files will be merged to a new translated pdf book.

This platform dramatically reduces translator's work load. What translators need to do is only to improve and modify
machine-translated work. They don't have to translate the book line by line.

The key points of this project are editting docx file on html, and the algorithm to replace terms. There is no perfect solution
to edit docx file on html structure while preserving its style till now.
